1、从句作主语，一般视为单数。   

例：That she will come and help us is certain.   

2、what引导的主语，如果从句的谓语或从句后的表语是复数，则主句从句视为复数。   

例：What are often regarded as poisonous fungi are sometimes safely edible.   

3、主语由两个（或以上）从句组成，也视为复数。   

例：When they will hold the meeting and who will represent us to attend the meeting have not been decided yet.   

when they will hold the meeting是第一个主语从句，who will represent us to attend the meeting是第二个主语从句，两个从句组合在一起作主语，此句中主语从句有两个，因此视为复数。
